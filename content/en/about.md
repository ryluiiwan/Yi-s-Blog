## üëâ This is [ryluiiwan](http://ryluiiwan.com)

Former TK influencer marketing professional (a mere salesperson), aspiring to learn Digital Marketing skills and knowledge (that's the current plan) for a career transition. Studied Data Science and Big Data Technology in university, with some basic programming knowledge and analytical thinking. After graduation, through various twists and turns, I stumbled into marketing and promotion. I enjoy eating, sleeping, strolling in parks, stargazing, moonwatching, reading, and having imaginative conversations with friends. I have a strong interest in exploring the essence and patterns of things.

Hope to become a person with inner strength.
