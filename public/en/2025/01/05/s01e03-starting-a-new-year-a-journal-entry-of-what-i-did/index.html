  <article><p>&ldquo;Doing nothing&rdquo; best describes this week&rsquo;s state. Strangely, although I really enjoy this slightly boring state where I don&rsquo;t have to do anything, I can&rsquo;t contentedly enjoy it, always feeling that I should use this time to do something, that I can&rsquo;t stop learning and improving. I constantly bounce between &rsquo;let&rsquo;s enjoy now and think later&rsquo; and &lsquo;regret doing nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brain can be deceptive, words are beautifully woven lies, forgiveness like love is temporary, nothing is eternal. Sometimes I think such evil thoughts. Amid expectations for the new year, there&rsquo;s also fear mixed in. Leaving a place, starting a new life - I fear unfamiliar environments, fear meeting not-so-kind bad people, fear life&rsquo;s balance tipping from the neutral end gradually toward the bad end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still diligently reading <a href="https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/book/26986954">The Story of a New Name: Neapolitan Novels 2</a>, and it&rsquo;s infuriating to see the comments section constantly attacking Lenu (one of the main female characters, from whose perspective the novel unfolds). In a novel about female friendship, the comment section is filled with malicious comments. I wonder why people are so keen on judging others&rsquo; inner thoughts and behaviors, and this judging desire seems similar to a &ldquo;desire to control&rdquo; that can be seen in every corner of the internet.</p>
<h2 id="dining-and-chatting">üë≠Dining and Chatting</h2>
<p>Monday evening, I met friends for dinner and chat, celebrating the new year early. That afternoon, the lazy sunlight felt warm on my clothes, making me feel wrapped in something soft. I finally walked that road behind my house that I&rsquo;d never taken before. I don&rsquo;t know why I was so busy this past year, leaving my neighborhood and surroundings so vague in my mind. That road is quiet, almost empty, a wide and lonely street with half the one-way road available for cycling. Going forward is a long downhill stretch - on a downhill, you just need to maintain direction and you&rsquo;ll keep moving forward. Taking this road to my usual movie theater greatly reduces travel time. There&rsquo;s a school at the end of the road, with an abandoned building across from it. No one knows its history; everyone just passes by.</p>
<p>For convenience and safety, I use &ldquo;Snoopy&rdquo; as my name for deliveries. Walking back home via that back road to get a package, I stared at the three characters &ldquo;Âè≤Âä™Âäõ&rdquo; (a misspelling of Snoopy in Chinese) on the delivery bag and fell into contemplation, then laughed helplessly. Sometimes, typos can bring us infinite joy.</p>
<p>In the evening, I met friends for Korean BBQ and chat, discussing everything from work to recent movies, eventually landing on characters from Jin Yong&rsquo;s novels. We confusedly mixed up various character relationships, arguing for quite a while, alternating between confusion and clarity, laughing until my sides hurt. It&rsquo;s always joyful dining and chatting with friends who share similar senses of humor and frequencies. I&rsquo;ve started rewatching <a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/33464863/">Hospital Playlist</a> recently, and I hope that when I&rsquo;m forty, I&rsquo;ll still have a group of friends to eat, drink, and laugh with.</p>
<h2 id="jealousy-is-an-emotion">üêèJealousy is an Emotion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why I feel this way, as I don&rsquo;t have strong awareness of my emotions. Sometimes, I can&rsquo;t even distinguish these emotions. Most people have attached an extremely negative label to the word &ldquo;jealousy,&rdquo; seeing it as evil, like wanting someone to do well but not too well, a mindset of silent competition.</p>
<p>Last month, I happened upon a used bookstore and browsed some children&rsquo;s picture books, including one about emotions. The emotion family consists of happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, shame, envy, surprise, anger, disgust, and love. In this picture book, jealousy was described as a &ldquo;little vinegar bottle&rdquo; - perhaps sour in taste, but as long as it doesn&rsquo;t harm anyone, jealousy is just another emotion.</p>
<p>Perhaps influenced by reading <a href="https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/book/26986954">The Neapolitan Novels</a>, where Ferrante, through Lenu&rsquo;s inner world, describes extensive psychological activities of Lenu&rsquo;s silent comparison and jealousy toward Lila. Yet this doesn&rsquo;t affect my fondness for both Lenu and Lila. Human nature has too many complex facets; judging what&rsquo;s good or bad in black-and-white terms is too simplistic. Judge actions, not thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="the-lucky-cat-is-a-fish">üò∫The Lucky Cat is a Fish</h2>
<p>At the supermarket this week, I visited the ornamental fish section and immediately spotted two white fish with duck-bill-like heads. The yellow label on the tank showed their nickname as <strong>Lucky Cat</strong>. Writing this now, I think: maybe I can get rich this year too. Later I checked Wikipedia; its scientific name is <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%85%E5%B0%BE%E9%AF%B0">Red-tailed Catfish</a>.</p>
<p>The supermarket is decorated more festively than last time. After growing up, perhaps because I can no longer receive New Year&rsquo;s money, I don&rsquo;t look forward to the New Year much. I might face relatives&rsquo; intrusive questions about salary and relationships. In the village, boundaries between people suddenly disappear, with occasional privacy invasions behind warm greetings. I have complex feelings about this - I like the warmth but hate privacy intrusions. People should maintain some distance; these boundaries must exist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while writing, I&rsquo;m getting sleepy. Don&rsquo;t want to continue writing. Recently reading the Neapolitan Novels, I want to train my writing skills. Ferrante&rsquo;s writing, though direct, is delicate and comfortable to read. I love this writing style. I really hope I can earn enough money to travel to Italy someday; I want to see her Naples with my own eyes, make a pilgrimage. Well, suddenly I have a new goal for the new year.</p>
<h2 id="books-films-and-audio">üé®Books, Films, and Audio</h2>
<p>This week I mainly watched <a href="https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/book/26986954">The Story of a New Name: Neapolitan Novels 2</a> and <a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/33464863/">Hospital Playlist</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the time I was sleeping. Ten hours every day. I&rsquo;m dizzy.</p>
